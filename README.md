# FAQs

## What is WorkFlowy?
[WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) is an app for lists. Use it for your to-do lists, notes, project outlines, bookmarks, journalling, or just about anything else.

## What does Paperback do?
Paperback updates the surface level appearance of the WorkFlowy web app. It cuts back on visual clutter and allows a more focused, distraction free experience. 

## Can I use this with Stylish and other scripting extensions?
It's worth a try, but likely to be buggy. The two aren't designed to work together.
